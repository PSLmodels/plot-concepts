# plot_concepts

This is place to post and discuss ideas for dynamic visualizations that rely on open source economics repositories. 

To post an idea for a dynamic vizualization, open a [new issue](https://github.com/open-source-economics/plot_concepts/issues/new) that describes the vizualization or email matt.h.jensen@gmail.com. Opening a new issue is preferable, but you will need to sign up for GitHub first. 

Your concept proposal should contain:
- A written description of your visualization proposal and explanation for why it is interesting and important.  
- A "napkin sketch" of the visualization as you see it. 
- A link to the open source code base that the visualization will rely on (preferably but not essentially, the code would be in a version-controlled repository). 
- If possible, technical tips and tricks for how run the code in order to obtain the data needed for the visualization. 

See the [issues](https://github.com/open-source-economics/plot_concepts/issues) in this repository for examples of other concept proposals.

You can also review [outstanding proposals](https://github.com/open-source-economics/plot_concepts/issues) and leave comments and suggestions.
